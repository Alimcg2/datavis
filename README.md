# Visiali

Visiali is a simple website created to showcase visualizations of datasets that are relevent to my life. The data is gathered mostly through APIs and datasets found through various locaitons. All of the graphs are made with R and some data wrangling is done in Python. 

Any data used in a visual is sourced at the bottom of the page.
